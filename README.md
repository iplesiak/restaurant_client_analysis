Analysis of a restaurants listed on YELP.
Question:
Which aspects of the restaurant matter most for customers?


Completed research indicates that to increase frequency of visits, restaurant should offer parking options, WiFi, and good pricing. 
Albeit with reservations there are two aspects, a restaurant requiring reservations would have a lower frequency of 
visitors, which could be desirable for a relaxed environment. So instituting reservations for restaurants entirely 
depends on their intentions.For restaurant ratings I found a positive relationship between appropriate and 
proportional prices, outdoor seating, quiet atmosphere, stylish/classy attire that is relative to the restaurant's 
prestige, and high amount of positive reviews. A negative relationship was found between ratings and noise levels, 
good for kids and high amounts of negative reviews. From this it can concluded that great care must be taken to 
serve customers at a high level and be conscientious about their experience.
